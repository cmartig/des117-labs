    <h2>Biography </h2>
    <p>
        Pierre-Auguste Renoir was born on the 25 of February <em>1841 </em> in <strong>Limoges, Haute- Vienne, France </strong>. As a young boy Renoir had an interest in sketching, but was more consumed by his talent to sing. Due to his family's financial struggles at the age of thirteen he was forced to leave school and abandon his musical talents in order to begin an apprenticeship at a porcelain factory. As time continued the position he held within the porcelain factory was replaced by a machine and he was forced out of the job, leading him to apply to art school.

Renoir began to study art under Charles Gleyre in Paris and found himself in the company of many other artists that would eventually begin the impressionist movement with him. Quickly, Renoir became a leader in the impressionist movement and his paintings, although at first unorthodox, became popular and brought him much success during his lifetime. Renoir's work often depicted lively scenes of people partipating in various activities from dancing to eating. He was well known for his ability to portray a moment caught in time, with fleeting light and dynamism throughout the canvas.

Later in life Renoir developed rheumatoid arthritis, which limited his mobility severely. He continued to make art despite his limited ability to hold a brush and move around the canvas. His last painting was a portrait of the Austrian actress, Tilla Durieux in 1914. On December 3rd of 1919 Renoir passed away in the town of Cagnes-sur-Mer, France. His work remains every popular for it's unique display of dappled light, color and movement.
