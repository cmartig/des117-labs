                <p class="padding"> When I was younger all I wanted was to adopt a dog from my local animal shelter. However I knew my nomadic lifestyle and crazy work hours were not ideal for owning a pet. Instead I often donated to funds such as the ASPCA or my local shelter. Although this was fulfilling, I never knew where exactly my money was going to and that is where Paw-Fect Pal's emerged.</p>

                <h2 class="background"> Purpose </h2>
                
                <p class="padding">Paw-Fect Pal's allows individual dogs to receive donations for medical care or expenses needed for their survival while in a shelter. This allows the shelter to use more of their funds towards upkeep and housing as many dogs as possible, rather then being drained by one or two expensive medical procedures or supplies for individual dogs. Paw-Fect Pal's allows you to virtually "adopt" and help take care of a dog in need, you'll receive updates and be able to see exactly how your money is helping!</p>

                <p class="padding">When you create an account on our website a whole new world opens up to you! Once logged in, you can visit the profiles of a large database of dogs in need. Each dog has a small biography that explains their specific need with donate button beneath it.  When you donate you could spend as little as you want, maybe enough to supply a new toy, or as large as you want, enough to cover an entire medical procedure. Once you make a donation you can check a box to receive updates on how your Pal is doing!  </p>
